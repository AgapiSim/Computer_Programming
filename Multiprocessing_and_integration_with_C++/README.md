## Multiprocessing - Parallel programming in Python

Provided files:


> MonteCarlo_pi_approx_1.1.py: Contains the code for the Monte Carlo approximation of Ï€. Three images (.png) have been produced by testing three different sizes of points.

> Volume_d_dim_ hypersphere_1.2.py: Contains the code for Monte Carlo approximation of the volume of hypersphere.

> Parallel_programming_1.3.py: Modified version of Volume_d_dim_ hypersphere_1.2.py for multiprocessing and examination of efficiency.




## Integration with C++ - Accelerating execution: C++ in Python and Numba



Provided files:

> person.cpp: C++ code for the module person with a class Person.

> person.py: Python code for the module person.

> Makefile: The file that gives instructions to the make command on how the C++ code in person.cpp should be compiled.
	 
> MA4_2.py: A test Python program that uses the module person.

> fibonacci_times_comparison.png: Image file showing the comparison of time efficiency of running the same code in Python, C++, and Numba. (This is produced by running the MA4_2.py script)
