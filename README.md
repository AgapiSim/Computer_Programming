## Exercises in the scope of Computer Programming II (1TD722)
Uppsala University - Winter semester 2023


## Course Description:

The course is directed towards students who have experienced programming in a first introductory course, Computer Programming I. 
In the course, the students will learn more about the programming language Python and how to write larger and more complex programs than in the first course. 
This is where someone moves from "having seen" to "knowing" programming. In addition, the course opens opportunities to take more advanced courses in computer science.

## Main topics covered:

  i.   Recursive thinking
  ii.  Recursive descent, exceptions and function objects
  iii. Linked Lists & Binary Tree Generation
  iv.  Multiprocessing & Integration with C++
